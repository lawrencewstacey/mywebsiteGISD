Lawrence Stacey is a PhD student in sociology at Ohio State University. His research interests include how gender and sexuality norms are reproduced and resisted via parenting practices, with particular attention paid to differences between biological and stepparents in children's gender socialization. He also is interested in the health of gender and sexual minorities, and the dating and hookup experiences of queer men on popular dating applications.
